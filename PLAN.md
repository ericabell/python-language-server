# Python Language Server Learning Plan

## Overview
This plan will guide you through building a Python language server from scratch, teaching you the core concepts of the Language Server Protocol (LSP) while creating a practical implementation. We'll conclude by creating an MCP server that integrates with Claude Code.

**Important Note**: Throughout this learning journey, we'll use Context7 to access the latest documentation and code examples from the official Language Server Protocol specification (`/microsoft/language-server-protocol`), Python AST documentation, and Model Context Protocol specification (`/modelcontextprotocol/specification` and `/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk`). This ensures we're learning from the most current and authoritative sources.

## Teaching Approach

### Interactive Learning
- After each phase, I'll ask you to explain key concepts back to me
- You'll implement specific functions while I provide guidance
- We'll debug issues together to reinforce understanding

### Practical Exercises
- Write test cases for each feature as we build it
- Analyze how VSCode or other editors use similar LSP features
- Compare your implementation with existing Python language servers

### Assessment Questions
Throughout the project, I'll ask questions like:
- "What would happen if we received a completion request for a file that wasn't open?"
- "How would you extend this to support import statement analysis?"
- "What are the performance implications of your current approach?"
