# Phase 4: Code Intelligence

## Learning Goals
- Advanced Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing and analysis
- Symbol table construction and maintenance
- Basic type inference techniques
- Cross-file dependency analysis
- Advanced diagnostic capabilities

## Mini-Projects
1. **AST Visitor Framework**: Build a flexible AST visitor system for different analysis tasks
2. **Type Inference Engine**: Create a simple type inference system for Python variables
3. **Import Resolver**: Build a tool that can resolve Python import statements
4. **Cross-file Analyzer**: Create a system that can analyze symbols across multiple files
5. **Advanced Diagnostics**: Implement checks for undefined variables, unused imports, etc.

## Implementation Goals
1. **AST Integration**: Use Python's `ast` module for comprehensive code analysis
2. **Symbol Tables**: Build and maintain symbol information across multiple files
3. **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Detect undefined variables, unused imports, and simple type mismatches
4. **Workspace Analysis**: Implement project-wide symbol resolution
