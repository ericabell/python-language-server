# Phase 3: Advanced Language Features

## Learning Goals
- Symbol analysis and scope resolution
- Code completion algorithms and ranking
- Go-to-definition implementation strategies
- Reference finding techniques
- Position-based language feature implementation

## Mini-Projects
1. **Scope Analyzer**: Build a tool that identifies Python scopes (function, class, module)
2. **Symbol Collector**: Create a utility that extracts all symbols from Python code
3. **Position Calculator**: Build functions to convert between line/column and AST node positions
4. **Completion Ranker**: Implement a simple algorithm to rank completion suggestions
5. **Reference Finder**: Create a tool to find all references to a given symbol

## Implementation Goals
1. **Completion**: Basic keyword and built-in function completion with contextual suggestions
2. **Go-to-Definition**: Navigate to function and variable definitions within the same file
3. **Find References**: Locate all usages of a symbol within the current document
4. **Symbol Resolution**: Build a basic symbol table for tracking definitions
