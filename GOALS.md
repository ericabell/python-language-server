# I'd like to learn more about how language servers work

# This project's goal is to create a small, basic Python language server that can demonstrate all the basic principles.

# Once the language server is working, I'd like to create an MCP server that uses it and that I can connect to Claude Code to help assist in working on Python coding projects.

# I want to start this project by you developing a small learning plan that helps me understand the steps in writing a Python language server from scratch.

# Please put the plan in PLAN.md in this directory so that I can review that before we start coding.

# I want you to take the role of a teacher and guide me through the process. At times, you should probe for understanding by either asking me a question or asking me to complete the next step, just like a good teacher would do.
