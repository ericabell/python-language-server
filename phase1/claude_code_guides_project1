Absolutely! Let's think through this step-by-step before we write any code. This is exactly
the right approach - understanding the problem and designing the solution first.

Step 1: Understanding the Goal

What are we trying to build?
A function that takes a JSON string and tells us:
1. Is it valid JSON?
2. Is it a valid JSON-RPC 2.0 message?
3. What type of message is it (request, response, or notification)?
4. What are the key parts of the message?

Why is this useful?
This will be the foundation for our language server - every message that comes in needs to be
parsed and understood before we can act on it.

Step 2: Understanding JSON-RPC 2.0 Message Types

From your reading, you know there are three types. Let's be very specific about what makes
each type valid:

Request:
- Must have: jsonrpc: "2.0", method (string), id (string or number)
- May have: params (object or array)

Notification:
- Must have: jsonrpc: "2.0", method (string)
- May have: params (object or array)
- Must NOT have: id (this is the key difference!)

Response:
- Must have: jsonrpc: "2.0", id (string or number)
- Must have exactly one of: result (any type) OR error (object)
- Must NOT have: method

Step 3: What Python Structures Do We Need?

Before we code, let's think about what we need:

1. An Enum for message types (REQUEST, RESPONSE, NOTIFICATION, INVALID)
2. A Result class to hold what we discovered (type, data, errors)
3. The main parsing function that does the work

Questions for you:

1. What should happen if the JSON is malformed? (like missing a closing brace)
2. What should we return if it's valid JSON but not valid JSON-RPC? (like missing the jsonrpc
field)
3. How detailed should our error messages be? Should we just say "invalid" or explain what's
wrong?

Think about these, and then we can design the exact Python structures we need. What are your
thoughts on these questions?
