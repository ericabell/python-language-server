# Phase 1: Understanding LSP Fundamentals

## Learning Goals
- Language Server Protocol architecture and communication model
- JSON-RPC 2.0 messaging format and structure
- Client-server relationship and lifecycle management
- Core LSP capabilities and their purposes
- Understanding requests, responses, and notifications

## Mini-Projects
1. **JSON-RPC Message Parser**: Build a simple function that can parse and validate JSON-RPC 2.0 messages
2. **Echo Server**: Create a basic server that echoes back any message it receives
3. **LSP Message Validator**: Build a validator that checks if messages conform to LSP message structure

## Implementation Goals
1. **Basic Server Setup**: Create a minimal LSP server that can start and respond to initialization
2. **Message Handling**: Implement JSON-RPC message parsing and response generation
3. **Lifecycle Management**: Handle initialize, initialized, and shutdown requests
4. **Capability Negotiation**: Implement basic client-server capability exchange

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Completed pre-reading materials
- [ ] Built JSON-RPC Message Parser
- [ ] Built Echo Server
- [ ] Built LSP Message Validator
- [ ] Implemented basic server setup
- [ ] Implemented message handling

## Knowledge Checks
- [ ] Explain the difference between notifications and requests in LSP
- [ ] Describe what happens during the server initialization handshake
- [ ] Build a sequence diagram showing the initialization flow
- [ ] Implement a simple ping-pong test between client and server
