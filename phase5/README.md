# Phase 5: MCP Server Integration

## Learning Goals
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) fundamentals and architecture
- Integration patterns between LSP and MCP
- Claude Code tool development and deployment
- MCP server lifecycle management
- Tool and resource design patterns

## Mini-Projects
1. **Basic MCP Server**: Create a simple "Hello World" MCP server using the Python SDK
2. **LSP Bridge**: Build a bridge that connects your LSP server to MCP
3. **Tool Interface Designer**: Create intuitive tool interfaces for common LSP operations
4. **Resource Provider**: Implement MCP resources that expose Python project information
5. **MCP Client Tester**: Build a simple client to test your MCP server

## Implementation Goals
1. **MCP Server**: Create an MCP server that wraps your language server capabilities
2. **Tool Interfaces**: Expose language server capabilities as MCP tools (diagnostics, completion, etc.)
3. **Resource Management**: Provide access to Python project information via MCP resources
4. **Claude Integration**: Test the MCP server with Claude Code and document the integration process
