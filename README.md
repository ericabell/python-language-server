# Python Language Server Learning Journey

A guided, hands-on exploration of building a Python Language Server from scratch, culminating in a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with Claude Code.

## Project Overview

This repository documents a collaborative learning journey where:

1. **Initial Goals**: Started with high-level learning objectives in [`GOALS.md`](GOALS.md)
2. **Learning Plan**: Developed a comprehensive 5-phase plan in [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md)
3. **Guided Implementation**: Working through each phase with hands-on projects and knowledge checks
4. **Progress Tracking**: Each phase has dedicated folders with READMEs to track progress
5. **Git History**: The entire learning journey is captured in commit history

## What You'll Build

By the end of this journey, you'll have:

- **A working Python Language Server** that implements core LSP features:
  - Document synchronization
  - Syntax error diagnostics
  - Code completion
  - Go-to-definition
  - Find references
  - Hover information
  
- **An MCP Server Integration** that exposes your language server capabilities to Claude Code and other MCP-compatible tools

- **Deep Understanding** of language server architecture, Python AST analysis, and AI tool integration

## Learning Approach

### Phase-Based Structure
The learning is organized into 5 phases, each building on the previous:

- **Phase 1**: LSP Fundamentals - Understanding the protocol and basic server setup
- **Phase 2**: Core Language Features - Document sync, diagnostics, hover
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Language Features - Completion, go-to-definition, references
- **Phase 4**: Code Intelligence - AST analysis, symbol tables, type inference
- **Phase 5**: MCP Integration - Connecting your language server to Claude Code

### Hands-On Learning
Each phase includes:
- **Pre-Reading**: Accessible tutorials followed by official documentation
- **Mini-Projects**: Small, focused projects (30-60 minutes each)
- **Implementation Goals**: Main deliverables for the phase
- **Knowledge Checks**: Assessment tasks to validate understanding

### Teaching Methodology
This project follows a teacher-student approach where:
- Concepts are explained step-by-step
- You implement solutions with guidance
- Progress is validated through knowledge checks
- Understanding is probed through questions and exercises

## Key Technologies & Concepts

- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Microsoft's protocol for editor-language server communication
- **JSON-RPC 2.0**: The messaging format used by LSP
- **Python AST**: Abstract Syntax Tree parsing and analysis
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Anthropic's protocol for AI tool integration
- **Static Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing code without executing it
- **Symbol Resolution**: Finding and tracking code symbols across files

## Learning Resources

The project leverages:
- **Context7**: For accessing the latest official documentation
- **Real-world Examples**: From existing language servers and tools
- **Hands-on Practice**: Building actual working components
- **Progressive Complexity**: Starting simple and adding sophistication

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Goals**: Read [`GOALS.md`](GOALS.md) to understand the motivation
2. **Study the Plan**: Review [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the complete learning roadmap
3. **Start Phase 1**: Begin with the pre-reading materials in [`phase1/README.md`](phase1/README.md)
4. **Track Progress**: Use the checkboxes in each phase's README to monitor advancement
5. **Commit Regularly**: Document your learning journey through meaningful commits

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion, you will:

✅ **Understand LSP Architecture**: Know how language servers communicate with editors  
✅ **Master Python AST**: Be proficient in static code analysis techniques  
✅ **Build Real Tools**: Have experience creating developer productivity tools  
✅ **Integrate with AI**: Understand how to connect code tools to large language models  
✅ **Practice Teaching**: Gain experience explaining complex technical concepts  

## Collaboration Notes

This is a collaborative learning project where:
- **Student**: Implements solutions, asks questions, validates understanding
- **Teacher**: Provides guidance, explanations, and knowledge validation
- **Both**: Track progress, document insights, and build toward the final goal

The entire journey is captured in this repository's commit history, creating a reusable learning resource for others interested in language server development.
